# LearnGo
This is my learnings from GoLang. I'm creating this page so that anyone who is new to GoLang can make use of this page.

# How to Run the program:
go run <filename>.go
  Eg: go run arjunarippa.go
  
# How to Compile the program:
go build <filename>.go # The program will be compiled and result would be saved for later use.
  Eg: go build arjunarippa.go
  
The above statment will create an executable file. This can simply be executed as no more build/run is required.
  Eg: ./arjunarippa
