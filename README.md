# LearnGo
These are my learnings from GoLang. I'm creating this page so that anyone who is new to GoLang can make use of this page.

# How to Run the program:
  Eg: go run arjunarippa.go
  
# How to Compile the program:
# The program will be compiled and result would be saved for later use.
  Eg: go build arjunarippa.go
  
The above statment will create an executable file. This can simply be executed as no more build/run is required.
  Eg: ./arjunarippa
 
# How to install libraries into Go repo:
  Eg: go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
